Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to identify distinct cell populations, explore gene expression patterns, and discover marker genes that can characterize specific clusters of cells. This analysis was carried out using the Scanpy library, a powerful tool for single-cell data processing and visualization.

Objectives
1.	Data Preprocessing and Quality Control: Filter low-quality cells and genes to ensure data integrity.
2.	Clustering Analysis: Identify groups of cells (clusters) based on their gene expression profiles.
3.	Marker Gene Identification: Detect genes that define and differentiate each cluster.
4.	Visualization: Use dimensionality reduction and heatmaps to interpret clustering and gene expression patterns.
5.	Biomarker Discovery: Identify candidate marker genes for specific cell types or clusters.

Analysis Workflow
1.	Quality Control:
o	Low-quality cells were filtered based on mitochondrial gene content and abnormal gene counts.
o	This step ensures that only high-quality cells are used for downstream analysis.
2.	Normalization and Feature Selection:
o	The data was normalized to account for differences in sequencing depth.
o	Highly variable genes were selected, as they are most informative for clustering.
3.	Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering:
o	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the high-dimensional data.
o	UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) was used for visualizing clusters in a two-dimensional space.
o	Clustering was done using the Louvain algorithm, a graph-based clustering method.
4.	Marker Gene Identification:
o	For each cluster, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified as potential marker genes.
o	These genes help distinguish one cluster from others.
5.	Visualization:
o	UMAP plots were generated to display gene expression patterns across clusters.
o	A heatmap was created to visualize the expression of top-ranked marker genes across all clusters.

Results
1. UMAP Visualization of Key Marker Genes
•	SKAP1 and CD247:
o	Highly expressed in a specific cluster (bottom-right of the UMAP plot).
o	These genes are likely markers for immune or T-cells, as both are associated with T-cell activation.
•	ROS1:
o	Strongly expressed in a single, distinct cluster (center of the UMAP).
o	Indicates this gene could serve as a unique biomarker for this cluster.
•	AQP4-AS1:
o	Highly expressed in two smaller clusters, suggesting it identifies unique or rare cell populations.
•	PARP8 and NCKAP5:
o	Show expression across multiple clusters, making them less specific as biomarkers.
2. Heatmap of Marker Genes
The heatmap of top marker genes across all clusters shows:
•	Cluster-specific expression patterns for identified genes.
•	Clear separation of clusters based on marker gene expression.

Key Findings
1.	Distinct Cell Populations:
o	Several distinct clusters of cells were identified using gene expression similarities.
o	UMAP plots clearly show these clusters and their relationships.
2.	Marker Genes:
o	SKAP1 and CD247: Serve as strong candidate biomarkers for immune/T-cells.
o	ROS1: A highly specific marker for a unique cluster.
o	AQP4-AS1: Highlights smaller, distinct populations.
3.	Cluster Interpretation:
o	The identified markers provide insight into potential cell types within the dataset.
o	SKAP1 and CD247 clusters likely correspond to immune cells due to their association with T-cell biology.

Future Directions
1.	Biological Interpretation:
o	Validate marker genes by comparing with known cell type annotations.
o	Perform functional enrichment analysis to understand the biological roles of each cluster.
2.	Integration with Other Datasets:
o	Combine this dataset with other scRNA-seq datasets for comparative analysis.
3.	Downstream Applications:
o	Use identified biomarkers for disease analysis, immune profiling, or tumor microenvironment studies.
